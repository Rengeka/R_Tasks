# Task 1: Basic Operations and Working with Vectors

## a) Arithmetic with Vectors

1.  Create a vector `x` containing numbers from 1 to 10.
2.  Multiply all elements by 2.
3.  Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the resulting
    vector.
4.  Find all elements greater than 5.

## b) Filtering

1.  Generate a vector of 20 random integers between 0 and 100 using:

    ``` r
    sample(0:100, 20)
    ```

2.  Select only the even numbers from this vector.

3.  Calculate the sum of these even numbers.
